The <head> of a website is where you can setup links to important style files (CSS files)
with <link> tag and JavaScript files you want to include before the page elements are loaded
with the <script> tag.

       The attributes are:
       href, the location (which can be on the internet)
       rel, the relationship between this file and the linked file (Confusingly think of as type)
       type, the media type, (think of as format) not neccisarry but often used-->

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change.

  The DOM is then what is changed by the JavaScript.

<!--The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
 It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

 The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device.

 The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
